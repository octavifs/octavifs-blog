      <description>Automatic lung cancer nodule detection Abstract Lung cancer is both the deadliest and one of the most frequently diagnosed forms of the disease. The main cause for the low survivability of lung cancer is due to its lack of early symptoms, which are only detected in terminal stages of the disease. It has been demonstrated that performing screenings in high-risk population increased the survivability by 20% but detecting lung lesions in CT imaging is time consuming and highly dependent on the skill of the radiologist.</description>
