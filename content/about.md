I'm a software consultant specialized in AI for healthcare. My track record includes the implementation of 2 CAD systems for automated screening of lung cancer nodules and retina pathologies.

I love turning open-ended research questions into products. I believe that the key to applied research is following an iterative approach, focusing first on the subproblems that will yield a better understanding of the overall goal. I find systems designed in such a manner to be loosely coupled, easier to scale and have better product focus.

If your company is going through similar challenges, [contact me](mailto:octavi@octavifs.me). I can help you bridge the gap between research and your product, define metrics and productionize your prototypes.
