I'm a software developer with a focus on data engineering and machine learning projects, particularly on healthcare. My track record in the field includes leading the development of a deep learning system for automated screening of multiple retinal diseases for a spanish telemedicine startup.

I deeply enjoy the challenge of turning open research questions into ready-to-use products, and I am not afraid of having to wear many hats, from research to product development and operations. Still, my greatest strenght lies in the capacity to help data science teams turn their MVPs into production-ready software.

I can help your data science team with tooling to scale experiments, preparing data pipelines, deploying and serving models, keep track of model performance and monitoring service status. If your company is going through similar challenges, [contact me](mailto:octavi@octavifs.com). Let's bridge the gap between research and production together.
