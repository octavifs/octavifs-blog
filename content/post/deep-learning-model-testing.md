This is a post. Here I want to talk about approaches to actually test new models before rolling them out to production.

Essentially show the strategy of having a specific validation dataset, with gold standard labels, which you test against. And you test the end to end model in production AND the candidate, and then can compare.

You can even compare with multiple versions of the trained thingy. And see how they stack against each other.

Sell the statelessness of the system, which is good.
