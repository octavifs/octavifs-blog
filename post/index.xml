      <description>This is my recipe to install Ubuntu 19.04 Disco Dingo on the Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th gen (2018). This guide should serve you as well for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, but the newer kernel and GNOME on 19.04 offer better power management and HiDPI support.

The X1 Carbon is an excellent laptop for developers, and even though its Linux support is good, getting it to work perfectly still requires some tinkering.</description>

      <description>This is how I&amp;rsquo;ve setup my Thinkpad X1 Carbon with functional fractional scaling support on Ubuntu 19.04. Hopefully this post serves as a beacon for everyone wanting a way out of the current buggy mess that is fractional scaling on Linux. The only limitation of this solution is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t support dual monitors with different DPI settings. External monitors work well, as long as the laptop screen is closed.</description>
