So this is a post placeholder. Just to test the waters and check that the theme setup is properly done.

{% include image.html path="2018-01-22-some-random-intro/sample-image.jpg" path-detail="2018-01-22-some-random-intro/sample-image@2x.jpg" alt="Sample Image" %}

## Some titles

And some more text.

    With a bunch of quotes, or code, or whatever it is.
    Which should look very nice.

Hopefully.
